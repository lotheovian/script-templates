# useful-scripts
## gitlab-ci.sh & gitlab-ci.yml
Basic CI files, directed at a gitlab/artifactory/springboot/docker/kubernetes environment with a prod, staging and devel cluster.

## kube-controller-setup.sh
I got tired of installing/setting up these applications on my servers, it's a small script that sets up users and installs a few applications (I really need to learn puppet to replace this)

## parallel-execution.sh
A small template for parallel execution in a script if GNU parallel isn't available.

## git_utils
A few shortcuts I made for git to make some of the repetative typing faster
